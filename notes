text box can use rows to make bigger

cancan
rails g cancan:ability
in models/Ability
user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)
can :read, :all # all vistors can read a book's description

How to check authorization (alone this won't do anything)
can :manage, Book do |book|
  book.try(:user) == user
end

Put into every controller, references above, gives a error looking page
authorize! :manage, @book

Add in application controller
rescue_from CanCan::AccessDenied do |exception|
  redirect_to root_path, notice: "You are not authorized to view this page" # notice root path means root of the controller
end

<% flash.each do |type, message| %>
  <div class="alert alert-info fade-in">
    <button class="close" data-dismiss="alert">x</button>
    <%= message %>
  </div>
<% end %>
